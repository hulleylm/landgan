# Landscape_GAN
Generative adversarial network that uses Google Maps satellite imagery and Nasa elevation data to generate new satellite images with elevation data. Intended for use in video games as world maps.

Final year project for BSc Computer Science at the University of Liverpool.

Training on 2,500 128x128 RGBA satellite images over 1,200 epochs (animated gif).
Combined RGBA images (set to a white background)
